May 21: Have been taking time off from learning while work is busy. Attending a d3.js meetup in Columbus, Ohio tonight, however, and attempting to complete their code practice. 
[JS Fiddle : OpenBeerDatabase API](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/1/)

And here is the final result of that --- not the prettiest, but it's real data! [Final JS Fiddle : OpenBeerDatabase API](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/5/)

[Lesson 20 D3.js Axes - Built onto the JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/6/)

And that's actually the last of the basic D3 lessons on DashingD3js.com before you hit a paywall. Overall, the previous tutorials were clearly written and easy to follow, and I feel that I have a good introduction to D3.

I came across this tutorial while building my OpenBeerDatabase exercise, so it fits that I'll work through it next, using the same code. This is the same beer data as previous but with the data starting from the bottom rather than the top, and labelled more nicely. [Making Bar Charts](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/7/)

[Making a scatterplot](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/8/) Same data as before, just more circles
