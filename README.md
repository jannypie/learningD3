15 D3.js Path Data Generator Line Example - This is where I being doubting if I'm smart enough in math to do D3 well - I've never heard of these linear interpolation types in any math class before

May 21: Have been taking time off from learning while work is busy. Attending a d3.js meetup in Columbus, Ohio tonight, however, and attempting to complete their code practice. 
[JS Fiddle : OpenBeerDatabase API](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/1/)

And here is the final result of that --- not the prettiest, but it's real data! [Final JS Fiddle : OpenBeerDatabase API](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/5/)

Back to DashingD3

[Lesson 20 D3.js Axes - Built onto the JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/6/)

And that's actually the last of the basic D3 lessons on DashingD3js.com before you hit a paywall. Overall, the previous tutorials were clearly written and easy to follow, and I feel that I have a good introduction to D3.


Tutorials from [alignedleft.com, Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I came across this tutorial while building my OpenBeerDatabase exercise, so it fits that I'll work through it next, using the same code. This is the same beer data as previous but with the data starting from the bottom rather than the top, and labelled more nicely. [Making Bar Charts](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/7/)

[Making a scatterplot](http://jsfiddle.net/d67FY/8/) Same data as before, just more circles

[Scatterplot using scales to plot data](http://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/fLwJG?editors=001)

[Scatterplot using scales and axes](http://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/EBHKG)

That's the end of the alignedleft tutorials. I understand scales and axes much better now than when I [read about them the first time](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/).

[Let's Make A Bar Chart I,II and III](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[CodePen Bar Chart with Axes, Labels, Scales](http://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/urfJv) I actually found these tutorials difficult to follow, probably because I am not quite quick enough with D3 yet to see the jumps from example to example. I modified the chart example, however, to something that worked for me and then built on that to create additional x-axis label and chart title.
